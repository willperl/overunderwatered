##### Analyze if your unhappy plant is over or under watered with advanced computer vision

The symptoms of over watering and under watering a plant are often identical to the human eye. But an AI Image Recognition Model can evaluate at a deeper level and recognize the symptoms that even a loving and experienced plant owner might not be able to see.

Upload a photo of your drooping plant and the model will assess whether it appears to be over watered or under watered, along with its confidence in that evaluation.
